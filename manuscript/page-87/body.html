it came all round the island. I hunted it down, but could never get near
enough to see—to localize it correctly. Sometimes it was overhead, and
sometimes it seemed under the water. Once or twice, too, I could have sworn
it was not outside at all, but within myself—you know—the way a sound in
the fourth dimension is supposed to come."</p><p>I was too much puzzled to pay much attention to his words. I listened
carefully, striving to associate it with any known familiar sound I could
think of, but without success. It changed in the direction, too, coming
nearer, and then sinking utterly away into remote distance. I cannot say
that it was ominous in quality, because to me it seemed distinctly musical,
yet I must admit it set going a distressing feeling that made me wish I had
never heard it.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"The wind blowing in those sand-funnels," I said</p></div> </div>
