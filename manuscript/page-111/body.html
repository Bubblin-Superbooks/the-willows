nothing had happened, follow our usual habits, go to bed, and so forth;
pretend we feel nothing and notice nothing. It is a question wholly of the
mind, and the less we think about them the better our chance of escape.
Above all, don't think, for what you think happens!"</p><p>"All right," I managed to reply, simply breathless with his words and the
strangeness of it all; "all right, I'll try, but tell me one more thing
first. Tell me what you make of those hollows in the ground all about us,
those sand-funnels?"</p><p>"No!" he cried, forgetting to whisper in his excitement. "I dare not,

glad. Don't try to. They have put it into my mind; try your hardest to
prevent their putting it into yours."</p></div> </div>
