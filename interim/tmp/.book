On the big maps this deserted area is painted in a fluffy\nblue, growing fainter in color as it leaves the banks, and across it may be\nseen in large straggling letters the word Sumpfe, meaning marshes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In high flood this great acreage of sand, shingle-beds, and willow-grown\nislands is almost topped by the water,</p>",

These willows never\nattain to the dignity of trees; they have no rigid trunks; they remain\nhumble bushes, with rounded tops and soft outline, swaying on slender stems\nthat answer to the least pressure of the wind; supple as grasses, and so\ncontinually shifting that they somehow give the impression that the entire\nplain is moving and alive. For the wind sends waves rising and falling over\nthe whole surface, waves of leaves instead of waves of water, green swells\nlike the sea, too, until the branches turn and lift, and then silvery white\nas their underside turns to the sun.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Happy to slip beyond the control of the stern banks, the Danube here\nwanders about at will among the intricate network of channels intersecting\nthe islands everywhere with broad avenues down which the waters</p>",

That very same morning, when the sky was reddening before\nsunrise, we had slipped swiftly through still-sleeping Vienna, leaving it a\ncouple of hours later a mere patch of smoke against the blue hills of the\nWienerwald on the horizon; we had breakfasted below Fischeramend under a\ngrove of birch trees roaring in the wind; and had then swept on the tearing\ncurrent past Orth, Hainburg, Petronell (the old Roman</p>",

We entered the land of desolation on wings, and in less\nthan half an hour there was neither boat nor fishing-hut nor red roof, nor\nany single sign of human habitation and civilization within sight. The\nsense of remoteness from the world of humankind, the utter isolation, the\nfascination of this singular world of willows, winds, and waters, instantly\nlaid its spell upon us both, so that we allowed laughingly to one another\nthat we ought by rights to have held some special kind of passport to admit\nus, and that we had, somewhat audaciously, come without asking leave into a\nseparate little kingdom of wonder and magic—a kingdom that was reserved\nfor the use of others who had a right to it, with everywhere unwritten\nwarnings to trespassers for those who had the imagination to discover them.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Though still early in the afternoon, the ceaseless</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">buffetings of a most\ntempestuous wind made us feel weary, and we at once began casting about for\na suitable camping-ground for the night. But the bewildering character of\nthe islands made landing difficult; the swirling flood carried us in shore\nand then swept us out again; the willow branches tore our hands as we\nseized them to stop the canoe, and we pulled many a yard of sandy bank into\nthe water before at length we shot with a great sideways blow from the wind\ninto a backwater and managed to beach the bows in a cloud of spray. Then we\nlay panting and laughing after our exertions on the hot yellow sand,\nsheltered from the wind, and in the full blaze of a scorching sun, a\ncloudless blue sky above, and an immense army of dancing, shouting willow\nbushes, closing in from all sides, shining with spray and clapping their\nthousand little hands as though to applaud the success of our efforts.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"What a river!\" I said to my companion, thinking of</p>",

How it\nstood up and shouted when the rains fell flat upon its face! And how its\nlaughter roared out when the wind blew up-stream and tried to stop its\ngrowing speed! We knew all its sounds and voices, its tumblings and\nfoamings, its unnecessary splashing against the bridges; that\nself-conscious chatter when there were hills to look on; the affected\ndignity of its speech when it passed through the little towns, far too\nimportant to laugh; and all these faint, sweet whisperings when the sun\ncaught it fairly in some slow curve and poured down upon it till the steam\nrose.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was full of tricks, too, in its early life before the great world knew\nit.

  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">appear again on the other side\nof the porous limestone hills and start a new river with another name;\nleaving, too, so little water in its own bed that we had to climb out and\nwade and push the canoe through miles of shallows.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And a chief pleasure, in those early days of its irresponsible youth, was\nto lie low, like Brer Fox, just before the little turbulent tributaries\ncame to join it from the Alps, and to refuse to acknowledge them when in,\nbut to run for miles side by side, the dividing line well marked, the very\nlevels different, the Danube utterly declining to recognize the newcomer.\nBelow Passau, however, it gave up this particular trick, for there the Inn\ncomes in with a thundering power impossible to ignore, and so pushes and\nincommodes the parent river that there is hardly room for them in the long\ntwisting gorge that follows, and the Danube is shoved this way and that\nagainst the cliffs, and forced to</p>",

Cormorants lined the banks in lonely\nplaces in rows like short black palings; grey crows crowded the\nshingle-beds; storks stood fishing in the vistas of shallower water that\nopened up between the islands, and hawks, swans, and marsh birds of all\nsorts filled the air with glinting wings and singing, petulant cries. It\nwas impossible to feel annoyed with the river's vagaries after seeing a\ndeer leap with a splash into the water at sunrise and swim past the bows of\nthe canoe; and often we saw fawns peering at us from the underbrush, or\nlooked straight into the brown eyes of a stag as we charged full tilt round\na corner and entered another reach of the river. Foxes, too, everywhere\nhaunted the banks, tripping daintily among the driftwood and disappearing\nso suddenly that it was impossible to see how they managed it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But now, after leaving Pressburg, everything changed a little, and the\nDanube became more serious.</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">It ceased trifling. It was half-way to the\nBlack Sea, within seeming distance almost of other, stranger countries\nwhere no tricks would be permitted or understood. It became suddenly\ngrown-up, and claimed our respect and even our awe. It broke out into three\narms, for one thing, that only met again a hundred kilometers farther down,\nand for a canoe there were no indications which one was intended to be\nfollowed.</p><p>\"If you take a side channel,\" said the Hungarian officer we met in the\nPressburg shop while buying provisions, \"you may find yourselves, when the\nflood subsides, forty miles from anywhere, high and dry, and you may easily\nstarve.

  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">consequently laid in an extra stock of provisions. For the rest,\nthe officer's prophecy held true, and the wind, blowing down a perfectly\nclear sky, increased steadily till it reached the dignity of a westerly\ngale.</p><p>It was earlier than usual when we camped, for the sun was a good hour or\ntwo from the horizon, and leaving my friend still asleep on the hot sand, I\nwandered about in desultory examination of our hotel. The island, I found,\nwas less than an acre in extent, a mere sandy bank standing some two or\nthree feet above the level of the river. The far end, pointing into the\nsunset, was covered with flying spray which the tremendous wind drove off\nthe crests of the broken waves. It was triangular in shape, with the apex\nup stream.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I stood there for several minutes, watching the impetuous crimson flood\nbearing down with a shouting roar, dashing in waves against the bank</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">as\nthough to sweep it bodily away, and then swirling by in two foaming streams\non either side. The ground seemed to shake with the shock and rush, while\nthe furious movement of the willow bushes as the wind poured over them\nincreased the curious illusion that the island itself actually moved.\nAbove, for a mile or two, I could see the great river descending upon me;\nit was like looking up the slope of a sliding hill, white with foam, and\nleaping up everywhere to show itself to the sun.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The rest of the island was too thickly grown with willows to make walking\npleasant, but I made the tour, nevertheless. From the lower end the light,\nof course, changed, and the river looked dark and angry. Only the backs of\nthe flying waves were visible, streaked with foam, and pushed forcibly by\nthe great puffs of wind that fell upon them from behind. For a short mile\nit was visible, pouring in and out among the islands, and then disappearing\nwith a huge sweep into the willows, which</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">closed about it like a herd of\nmonstrous antediluvian creatures crowding down to drink. They made me think\nof gigantic sponge-like growths that sucked the river up into themselves.\nThey caused it to vanish from sight. They herded there together in such\noverpowering numbers.</p><p>Altogether it was an impressive scene, with its utter loneliness, its\nbizarre suggestion; and as I gazed, long and curiously, a singular emotion\nbegan to stir somewhere in the depths of me. Midway in my delight of the\nwild beauty, there crept, unbidden and unexplained, a curious feeling of\ndisquietude, almost of alarm.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A rising river, perhaps, always suggests something of the ominous; many of\nthe little islands I saw before me would probably have been swept away by\nthe morning; this resistless, thundering flood of water touched the sense\nof awe. Yet I was aware that my uneasiness lay</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">deeper far than the emotions\nof awe and wonder. It was not that I felt. Nor had it directly to do with\nthe power of the driving wind—this shouting hurricane that might almost\ncarry up a few acres of willows into the air and scatter them like so much\nchaff over the landscape. The wind was simply enjoying itself, for nothing\nrose out of the flat landscape to stop it, and I was conscious of sharing\nits great game with a kind of pleasurable excitement. Yet this novel\nemotion had nothing to do with the wind. Indeed, so vague was the sense of\ndistress I experienced, that it was impossible to trace it to its source\nand deal with it accordingly, though I was aware somehow that it had to do\nwith my realization of our utter insignificance before this unrestrained\npower of the elements about me. The huge-grown river had something to do\nwith it too—a vague, unpleasant idea that we had somehow trifled with\nthese great elemental forces in whose power we lay helpless every hour of\nthe</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">day and night. For here, indeed, they were gigantically at play\ntogether, and the sight appealed to the imagination.</p><p>But my emotion, so far as I could understand it, seemed to attach itself\nmore particularly to the willow bushes, to these acres and acres of\nwillows, crowding, so thickly growing there, swarming everywhere the eye\ncould reach, pressing upon the river as though to suffocate it, standing in\ndense array mile after mile beneath the sky, watching, waiting, listening.\nAnd, apart quite from the elements, the willows connected themselves subtly\nwith my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow by reason of their\nvast numbers, and contriving in some way or other to represent to the\nimagination a new and mighty power, a power, moreover, not altogether\nfriendly to us.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Great revelations of nature, of course, never fail to impress in one way or\nanother, and I was no stranger to</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">moods of the kind. Mountains overawe and\noceans terrify, while the mystery of great forests exercises a spell\npeculiarly its own. But all these, at one point or another, somewhere link\non intimately with human life and human experience. They stir\ncomprehensible, even if alarming, emotions. They tend on the whole to\nexalt.</p><p>With this multitude of willows, however, it was something far different, I\nfelt. Some essence emanated from them that besieged the heart. A sense of\nawe awakened, true, but of awe touched somewhere by a vague terror. Their\nserried ranks, growing everywhere darker about me as the shadows deepened,\nmoving furiously yet softly in the wind, woke in me the curious and\nunwelcome suggestion that we had trespassed here upon the borders of an\nalien world, a world where we were intruders, a world where we were not\nwanted or invited to remain—where we ran grave risks perhaps!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The feeling, however, though it refused to yield its</p>",
  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">meaning entirely to\nanalysis, did not at the time trouble me by passing into menace. Yet it\nnever left me quite, even during the very practical business of putting up\nthe tent in a hurricane of wind and building a fire for the stew-pot. It\nremained, just enough to bother and perplex, and to rob a most delightful\ncamping-ground of a good portion of its charm. To my companion, however, I\nsaid nothing, for he was a man I considered devoid of imagination. In the\nfirst place, I could never have explained to him what I meant, and in the\nsecond, he would have laughed stupidly at me if I had.</p><p>There was a slight depression in the center of the island, and here we\npitched the tent. The surrounding willows broke the wind a bit.</p><p>\"A poor camp,\" observed the imperturbable Swede when at last the tent stood\nupright, \"no stones and precious little firewood. I'm for moving on early\ntomorrow—eh? This sand won't hold anything.\"</p>",
  "page-29": "<p>But the experience of a collapsing tent at midnight had taught us many\ndevices, and we made the cozy gipsy house as safe as possible, and then set\nabout collecting a store of wood to last till bed-time. Willow bushes drop\nno branches, and driftwood was our only source of supply. We hunted the\nshores pretty thoroughly. Everywhere the banks were crumbling as the rising\nflood tore at them and carried away great portions with a splash and a\ngurgle.</p><p>\"The island's much smaller than when we landed,\" said the accurate Swede.\n\"It won't last long at this rate.

But for</p>",
  "page-30": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the moment he was hidden by the willows,\nand I could not find him.</p><p>\"What in the world's this?\" I heard him cry again, and this time his voice\nhad become serious.</p><p>I ran up quickly and joined him on the bank. He was looking over the river,\npointing at something in the water.</p><p>\"Good heavens, it's a man's body!\" he cried excitedly. \"Look!\"</p><p>A black thing, turning over and over in the foaming waves, swept rapidly\npast. It kept disappearing and coming up to the surface again. It was about\ntwenty feet from the shore, and just as it was opposite to where we stood\nit lurched round and looked straight at us. We saw its eyes reflecting the\nsunset, and gleaming an odd yellow as the body turned over. Then it gave a\nswift, gulping plunge, and dived out of sight in a flash.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"An otter, by gad!\" we exclaimed in the same breath,</p>",
  "page-31": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">laughing.</p><p>It was an otter, alive, and out on the hunt; yet it had looked exactly like\nthe body of a drowned man turning helplessly in the current. Far below it\ncame to the surface once again, and we saw its black skin, wet and shining\nin the sunlight.</p><p>Then, too, just as we turned back, our arms full of driftwood, another\nthing happened to recall us to the river bank. This time it really was a\nman, and what was more, a man in a boat. Now a small boat on the Danube was\nan unusual sight at any time, but here in this deserted region, and at\nflood time, it was so unexpected as to constitute a real event. We stood\nand stared.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Whether it was due to the slanting sunlight, or the refraction from the\nwonderfully illumined water, I cannot say, but, whatever the cause, I found\nit difficult to focus my sight properly upon the flying apparition.

  "page-32": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sort of flat-bottomed\nboat, steering with a long oar, and being carried down the opposite shore\nat a tremendous pace. He apparently was looking across in our direction,\nbut the distance was too great and the light too uncertain for us to make\nout very plainly what he was about. It seemed to me that he was\ngesticulating and making signs at us. His voice came across the water to us\nshouting something furiously, but the wind drowned it so that no single\nword was audible. There was something curious about the whole\nappearance—man, boat, signs, voice—that made an impression on me out of\nall proportion to its cause.</p><p>\"He's crossing himself!\" I cried. \"Look, he's making the sign of the\nCross!\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I believe you're right,\" the Swede said, shading his eyes with his hand\nand watching the man out of sight.

Mist, too, had begun to ruse, so that the air was hazy.</p><p>\"But what in the world is he doing at nightfall on this flooded river?\" I\nsaid, half to myself. \"Where is he going at such a time, and what did he\nmean by his signs and shouting? D'you think he wished to warn us about\nsomething?\"</p><p>\"He saw our smoke, and thought we were spirits probably,\" laughed my\ncompanion. \"These Hungarians believe in all sorts of rubbish; you remember\nthe shopwoman at Pressburg warning us that no one ever landed here because\nit belonged to some sort of beings outside man's world! I suppose they\nbelieve in fairies and elementals, possibly demons, too.

Neither the otter nor the\nboatman, for instance, received the honor of a single mention, though\nordinarily these would have furnished discussion for the greater part of\nthe evening.

The long day's battle with wind and\nwater—such wind and such water!—had tired us both, and an early bed was\nthe obvious program. Yet neither of us made the move for the tent. We lay\nthere, tending the fire, talking in desultory fashion, peering about us\ninto the dense willow bushes, and listening to the thunder of wind and\nriver.

  "page-39": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">bit the sound of our voices became a trifle\nunreal and forced; whispering would have been the fitting mode of\ncommunication, I felt, and the human voice, always rather absurd amid the\nroar of the elements, now carried with it something almost illegitimate.

They rose upwards in a\ncontinuous stream from earth to sky, vanishing utterly as soon as they\nreached the dark of the sky. They were interlaced one with another, making\na great column, and I saw their limbs and huge bodies melting in and out of\neach other, forming this serpentine line that bent and swayed and twisted\nspirally with the contortions of the wind-tossed trees. They were nude,\nfluid shapes, passing up the bushes, within the leaves almost—rising up in\na living column into the heavens.

A good pile of wood lay close at hand, and the\nabsence of wind made my duties easy.

He had been very quiet\nall the afternoon, engaged in re-caulking the canoe, strengthening the tent\nropes, and fishing for driftwood while I slept.

It seemed to come across to us in the darkness from the waste\nof swamps and willows opposite. It was repeated at regular intervals, but\nit was certainly neither the sound of a bell nor the hooting of a distant\nsteamer.

  "page-87": "<p>\"I've heard it all day,\" said my companion. \"While you slept this afternoon\nit came all round the island.

I listened\ncarefully, striving to associate it with any known familiar sound I could\nthink of, but without success. It changed in the direction, too, coming\nnearer, and then sinking utterly away into remote distance. I cannot say\nthat it was ominous in quality, because to me it seemed distinctly musical,\nyet I must admit it set going a distressing feeling that made me wish I had\nnever heard it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"The wind blowing in those sand-funnels,\" I said</p>",

In my excitement I ran frantically to and fro about the island,\ncalling him by name, shouting at the top of my voice the first words that\ncame into my head. But the willows smothered my voice, and the humming\nmuffled it, so that the sound only traveled a few feet round me.

But it's all over now anyhow.\nThey've found a victim in our place!\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then he dropped back upon his blankets and went to sleep literally under my\neyes.
